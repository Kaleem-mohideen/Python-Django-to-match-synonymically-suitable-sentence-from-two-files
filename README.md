# Python-to-match-synonymically-suitable-sentence-from-two-files
Develop an algorithm using python-3 that will take two inputs,

Input 1: A sentence in string format
Input 2: A text file (*.txt) with a list of sentences

compares input 1 with all sentences in Input 2 and returns the most synonymically suitable sentence from Input 2.

Add necessary boundary/fail-safe conditions and validation to make the same robust, package as an application with GUI.
